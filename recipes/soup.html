            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 quarts chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1 quart water</li>
                    <li>1 store-bought roast chicken</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 large onions, cut into medium dice</li>
                    <li>2 large carrots, peeled and cut into rounds or half rounds</li>
                    <li>2 large stalks celery, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring broth and water to a simmer over medium-high heat in a large soup kettle. Meanwhile, separate chicken meat from skin and bones; reserve meat. Add skin and bones to the simmering broth. Reduce heat to low, partially cover and simmer until bones release their flavor, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Strain broth through a colander into a large container; reserve broth and discard skin and bones. Return kettle to burner set on medium-high.</li>
                    <li>Add oil, then onions, carrots and celery. Saute until soft, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add chicken, broth and thyme. Bring to a simmer. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days in advance. Return to a simmer before adding the extras of your choice.)</li>

                </ol>
